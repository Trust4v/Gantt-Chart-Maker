# Gantt-Chart-Maker
### A program made by Gustav Sommar

## To use this chart maker all you need to do is:

### Step 1: Download the program.

### Step 2: Open the python script in the code editor of you choice and download the pip files it needs.

### Step 3: Put the script inside a folder and create another folder inside that folder and name it to "input" (case sensative), this will be your input (where you put the excelfile).

### Step 4: Make sure you have the correct format, three colomn:

#### Colomn 1: 

Title : tag_id

Content : This will contain all the labels for the data, this will be displayed on the left in the program.

#### Colomn 2: 

Title : starttime

Content : This contains the starttimes for each label

#### Colomn 3: 

Title : endtime

Content : This contains the endtimes for each label

#### Step 5: If all above is done then you can just run the software and everything should work.

## NOTES:
### 1
If you want something to be "selected" (another color in the chart as well as being listed at the top) either name it "Cowbrush" or change the variable "specified_tag_id" to whatever.

### 2
To see how the program looks simply download and open the index file.
